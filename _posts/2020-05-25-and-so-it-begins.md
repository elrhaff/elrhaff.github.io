title: And So It Begins
---

I decided to start this blog to keep track of side projects and help others with things I struggled with. This includes programming languages, libraries, best practices, etc.

### What to expect

I will most likely be writing about:
* All  things python
* Machine learning/Deep learning, 
* Pytorch/Tensorflow, distributed training, model serving
* High Performance Computing
* Docker, Kubernetes, Kubeflow
* Apache Spark
* Apache Beam
* Building CI/CD pipelines with CircleCI/Github Actions 
* C++

See you around!
